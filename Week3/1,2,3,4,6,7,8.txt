6) To avoid race conditions, ynchronization techniques such as locks, semaphores can be used to ensure that only one thread or process can access shared resources at a time.
Deadlock can be prevented by eliminating any of the four  conditions, 1)which are mutual exclusion, 2)hold and wait, 3)no preemption, and 4)circular wait.

7) The fork() Function generates new processes while simultaneously preserving its parent process. whereas The exec creates new processes but doesn't preserve the parent process.

8) Processes are basically the programs that are dispatched from the ready state and are scheduled in the CPU for execution
Thread is the segment of a process which means a process can have multiple threads and these multiple threads are contained within a process
